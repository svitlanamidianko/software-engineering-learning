# CS162 - Software Engineering

Students are free to suggest modifications to this code by cloning, modifying and submitting a pull request.  It is suggested that students initially sketch out the modification and confirm with the course instructor that it is a suitable modification.  Open an issue, as part of the suggestion.  If the course instructor agrees then go ahead and create the entire modification (as a pull request). Once merged, then the student will be eligible for a 4 on the most relevant LO for the next assignment.  If 3 such modifications are accepted then the scores may be combined into a single 5 (at the students discretion).  Modifications must be either substantive explanations, or else significant reworking/creation of class exercises.

Currently, the topic that needs documentation the most is for the initial setup.  Hint hint!  This would entail: a nice description of how to get a github account, how to install the latest version of python 3, how to pull this repo, and how to suggest changes to the repo.

Some of these directories will not align with the most recent version of the syllabus.  In all such cases the syllabus should be viewed as the authoritative source of information and you are encouraged to inform your instructor of the discrepancy.



## Editors:
It is strongly recommended that you use one of the following editors:
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
 - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not Visual Studio itself!)
 - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
This list is not exhaustive, and there are a lot of good editors out there (see also Emacs and Vim if you want to be old school).
However it is essential that your code editor is powerful. It should be possible to install plugins which perform particular functionality (eg. make git easier to use, autoformat your code on save, have multiple cursors simultaneously).

The [FAQ](faq.md) provides links to short guides on how to install some of the editors and configure them as proper python development environments.

### Autoformatting
Please use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to automatically format your code. If everyone uses automatic code formatting then it will save everyone a lot of time when working together. It's the worst when you pull someone else's code, change a single line, hit save, and hundreds of lines of changes occur.

If you don't like how black has formatted the code, then you can take a deep breath
and think about how standardization is important, and how it helps to avoid
endless debates about how to best layout code. Then you can move on to writing other
code with the time that you have saved avoiding those debates.

## Miscellaneous tips:
 - [Your missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/):
This is a great resource to provide some high level guidance on better using a wide range of tools. For example, shell scripts, command line tools, git, debugging, and profiling. 
 - [Stuff Everyone Knows Except You](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/laurie-voss-cto-of-npm-gives-engineering-fundamentals-talk): 
This is a great talk covering a wide range of topics. It packs in loads of technical tips and life advice.
