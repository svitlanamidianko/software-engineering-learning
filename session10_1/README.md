## SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy is a object-relational-mapper (ORM).  This means that it is able
to map from object-oriented code that you write in Python into SQL commands
that a database understands.

This layer of abstraction can allow an engineer to focus on writing good
object-oriented code, while SQLAlchemy will then map this into easy access on a
database.  Having a layer of abstraction allows one to easily change the
underlying database.  It is common for testing code to use a SQLite database,
while in production the code instead connects to a beefy server that is
able to satisfy many simultaneous queries coming from many machines.

## SQLAlchemy vs. SQLite3 

Why don't we just use SQLite3 in Python (as seen in `SQLite3Sample.py`)?

Using an ORM like SQLAlchemy allows code to be used unchanged when connecting to different databases. This might allow us to use different databases in different contexts. Maybe we want fast unittests to run against a simple and small sqlite database, however we want to run a hefty server running Postgres in production.  All that will need to be changed is the connection string (which can even be set in an environment variable).

For comparisons with an SQLite3 implementation in Python, compare `SQLAlchemySample.py` and `SQLite3Sample.py`. Check out this [link](http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) to read more about when SQLite works well and when it doesn't.

## SQLAlchemy Tutorial 

Work through the SQLAlchemy tutorial here and then answer the questions at the bottom of the page. 

### 1. Local Setup 

First, install SQLAlchemy in terminal with:

```bash
$ pip install sqlalchemy
```

### 2. Setup on a Python Module 

#### Import SQLALchemy 

```python 
import sqlalchemy
``` 

#### Create Engine 

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine 
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo = True)
```
 
What's happening with the `create_engine()` function?

The engine connects to the database, and this function specifies which database it should connect to.

What is `sqlite:///`? Firstly, this initialises an SQLite Database, which allows us to use SQLite syntax the way we have learnt in prior classes.

`:memory:` simply implies that the SQLite database will not persist beyond individual sessions.
The database will only persist as long as the application instance is running. 

If we do: 

```python
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///try_database.db') 
```

Then this creates a local .db file named `try_database.db` (if it doesn't exist already on your path). We will learn how to use SQLAlchemy to open up the .db file and see if there are any new entries. This `database.db` file will persist locally.

#### Connect to engine 

Now, connect to the engine interface that you created using the default `connect()` function. 

```python
engine.connect() 
```

#### Declare a Base 

The base maintains a catalogue of classes and tables in the base; each application will usually have one. 

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
Base = declarative_base() 
```

After declaring a base, we will be able to define classes relative to the base. So each class should be created as class `'tablename'(Base)`.

#### Create a Table Mapping

Let's initialise a simple table `Users` by initialising a User class and writing a `__repr__()`method to represent the schema. 

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey 
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker 

class User(Base):
	__tablename__ = 'users'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
	name = Column(String)
	insurance_id = Column(Integer)

	def __repr__(self):
		return "<User(id={0}, name={1}, insurance_id={2})>".format(self.id, self.name, self.insurance_id)
```

Let's create another table to display foreign relationships.

```python
class Insurance(Base):
	__tablename__ = 'insurance'
	id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.insurance_id'), primary_key = True)
	claim_id = Column(Integer)
	users = relationship(User)
```

#### Create the Table Schema

After defining the schema of the table, we will need to actually create it in our database.

We have to call: 

```python
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

This is very important, as without calling `create_all(engine)` and binding it to the engine, the schema will not be initialised. Your table should now be created, and you will be able to add elements to it. 

## Adding Elements to the SQLAlchemy 

Create an instance of your `User` class with: 

```python
user = User(id = 1, name='sterne', insurance_id=1234)
```

And then add it to your DB, by starting a session. 

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker  

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session() 
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```

`user` should now be in your database! 

## Querying your Table

Let's check if `user` is in the database.

```python
print(session.query(User).filter_by(name='sterne').first())
```

It should print out: 

```
<User(id=1, name=sterne, insurance_id=1234)>
```
 
Great! 

## Reflecting an Existing Database with SQLAlchemy

Reflecting a table simply means being able to read its metadata, and being able to use SQLAlchemy to read the contents of the table. 

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, MetaData
metadata = MetaData()
users = Table('users', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)
```
Load the table `users` that you initialised before with the above function.

The `autoload_with=engine` parameter ensures that it's connecting to the right engine interface.

### Print table metadata

The `__repr__()` method that you defined in your `User(Base)` class will return a string detailing the details of your database in the format you chose.

```
print(repr(users))
```


## Questions

Use the tutorial above as a guide to the following exercises. After reading the tutorial, check out the `SQLAlchemySample.py` file for a working implementation. 

### Bank loans

From the bank loan exercise at the beginning of the unit:
1. Rewrite all the `CREATE TABLE` commands for the Clients and Loans tables
to now use SQLAlchemy. The SQLAlchemy commands should also create primary key
and foreign key constraints where appropriate.
2. Rewrite an `INSERT` command to now use SQLAlchemy. In particular, you
should hold all the values in a standard Python container (e.g. list,
dictionary, or namedtuple), or a combination of Python containers (e.g. list of
dictionaries).  The insertions should all happen in a single transaction.
3. Rewrite a `SELECT` query and an `UPDATE` command to now use SQLAlchemy.
4. Now that you better understand indexing, modify your python code to also
create indexes on relevant columns so that none of your queries from the
previous question will do a full table scan.
4. (Optional) Get SQLAlchemy to output the real SQL commands that it sends to
SQLite (this is shown in the recommended tutorial on SQLAlchemy).  How do these
commands compare with the SQL that you wrote manually?  Identify any
differences, and find out why SQLAlchemy has done it differently.

### Online retailer
From the session on transactions:
1. Rewrite all the `CREATE TABLE` commands for the tables contained in
`retail.sql` to now use SQLAlchemy. The SQLAlchemy commands should also create
primary key and foreign key constraints where appropriate.
2. Rewrite all the `INSERT` commands to now use SQLAlchemy. In particular, you
should hold all the values in a standard Python container (e.g. list,
dictionary, or namedtuple), or a combination of Python containers (e.g. list of
dictionaries).  The insertions should all happen in a single transaction.
3. Rewrite all your transactions from the exercise to now use SQLAlchemy.
4. (Optional) Get SQLAlchemy to output the real SQL commands that it sends to
SQLite (this is shown in the recommended tutorial on SQLAlchemy).  How do these
commands compare with the SQL that you wrote manually?  Identify any
differences, and find out why SQLAlchemy has done it differently.

### (Optional) Unit of Work
SQLAlchemy uses the unit-of-work design pattern to decide when to send updates to the
database.  Read up on the unit-of-work design pattern, and then look at the
source code of SQLAlchemy where it implements it:

https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/unitofwork.py

Now write a very high-level python implementation which captures the essential
idea behind the design, while skipping over much of the complexity in a real
implementation.
